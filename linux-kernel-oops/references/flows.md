## Entry point to all flows

Analysis uses sequential agents with separate identities. Do not combine
phases in a single agent — strict separation prevents premature analysis
during data collection.

### Progress tracking

Before launching any agent, create a todo list so the user can track
pipeline progress:

| id | title |
|----|-------|
| `step-1-fetcher` | Step 1 — Fetcher (pre-fetch vmlinux / git / distro packages) |
| `step-2-collector` | Step 2 — Collector (fundamentals, backtrace, source mapping) |
| `step-3-analyst` | Step 3 — Analyst (root cause, fix candidates, email) |
| `step-4-patcher` | Step 4 — Patcher (patch email) |
| `step-5-factchecker` | Step 5 — Fact checker (verify source quotes and metadata) |
| `step-6-patchreviewer` | Step 6 — Patch reviewer (correctness gate) |

Mark each todo `in_progress` when its agent is launched and `completed`
when it finishes. Skip / mark `cancelled` any step that does not apply
(e.g. Step 1 only when no distro or syzbot signals are present, Step 4/6
if no `report.patch` was produced, or Step 6 if patcher returned
`PATCH_FAILED`).

### Vmcore input routing

If the user supplied a vmcore, run **Vmcore Evidence Acquisition** before
considering the legacy Fetcher. Read [vmcore-evidence.md](vmcore-evidence.md)
and use the vmcore evidence agent. Do not pass raw vmcore to later agents.

After evidence acquisition:

- Route a primary Oops, Panic, BUG, or WARNING signature to the existing
  crash-type flow, using extracted text evidence as its input.
- Route XFS lock or log evidence without a primary crash signature to the
  **XFS hang / filesystem deadlock** flow in [xfs-hang.md](xfs-hang.md).
- Otherwise stop at generic vmcore triage with the evidence bundle and state
  the exact additional crash commands needed.

Do not launch the legacy Fetcher merely because a vmcore bundle was supplied
with matching vmlinux and source already available. The Fetcher continues to
prepare missing artifacts for text-Oops reports; it does not replace crash
evidence acquisition.

### Step 1 — Launch the fetcher agent (optional, recommended for syzbot and distro oops)

Launch [`agents/fetcher.agent.md`](../agents/fetcher.agent.md) using a
**small/fast model** (e.g. Claude Haiku) when **any** of the following apply:
- The oops is from **syzbot** (vmlinux URL present in the email)
- The oops is from **Ubuntu** (UNAME matches `X.Y.Z-N-generic` with `~` in
  the version header — Launchpad git checkout + ddeb download)
- The oops is from **Debian** (UNAME matches `X.Y.Z+debN-amd64` —
  pool index lookup + `-dbg` package download)
- The oops is from **Fedora** (UNAME matches `X.Y.Z-N.fcNN.x86_64` —
  Koji RPM download + CKI git checkout)
- The HEAD commit SHA is already known from any other source (git checkout
  can be pre-staged regardless of distro)

Skip the fetcher only when none of the above apply (e.g. a plain mainline
oops with no vmlinux URL and no known HEAD commit).

Launch with:
- The full oops text
- The kernel source tree path
- The report output directory path

The fetcher runs concurrently with your review of the oops. Wait for it
to complete and confirm `prefetch.md` exists before launching the collector.
If the fetcher is not launched, the collector handles all acquisition steps
itself.

### Step 2 — Launch the collection agent

Launch [`agents/collector.agent.md`](../agents/collector.agent.md) with:
- The full oops text
- The output path for report.md
- The kernel source tree path
- The vmlinux URL (if known)
- Any other pre-extracted facts (commit, MSGID, etc.)

Wait for the agent to complete and confirm report.md exists on disk before
proceeding.

### Step 3 — Launch the analysis agent

Launch [`agents/analyst.agent.md`](../agents/analyst.agent.md) with:
- The path to report.md written by the collection agent
- The path to backtrace.json in the same directory (if it exists)
- The time Phase 2 took (so the analyst knows its remaining budget)
- The MSGID (for the reply email)
- The kernel source tree path
- The external report URL base (from local.md `External URL for reports`)

Wait for the agent to complete.

### Step 4, 5, 6 — Launch the patch agent (conditional), fact checker (always), and patch reviewer (conditional)

After the analyst completes:

- **Steps 4 and 5** can run in parallel — the patcher and fact-checker do
  not touch each other's sections of report.md.
- **Step 6** (patch reviewer) must wait for the patcher to finish, since
  it reviews the formatted `patch-email.txt`.

#### Step 4 — Patch agent (conditional)

Check whether `report.patch` exists in the report archive directory. Launch
[`agents/patcher.agent.md`](../agents/patcher.agent.md) **only** if:

- `report.patch` exists (analyst identified a new fix), **and**
- The analysis confidence is high (analyst did not mark the fix as speculative)

Launch with:
- The path to `report.patch`
- The path to `report.md`
- The kernel source tree path
- The `PATCH_BASE` commit/tag noted in report.md
- The MSGID (for `In-Reply-To`)
- The external report URL base (from local.md)

#### Step 5 — Fact checker (always)

Always launch [`agents/factchecker.agent.md`](../agents/factchecker.agent.md)
using a **small/fast model** (e.g. Claude Haiku) — the task is mechanical
(file lookup, string comparison, git commands) and does not require deep
reasoning.

Launch with:
- The path to `report.md`
- The path to `analysis-email.txt` (if it exists in the same directory)
- The path to `backtrace.json` (if it exists in the same directory)
- The kernel source tree path
- The `PATCH_BASE` commit/tag noted in report.md

#### Step 6 — Patch reviewer (conditional, after Step 4)

Launch [`agents/patchreviewer.agent.md`](../agents/patchreviewer.agent.md)
**only** if Step 4 produced a `patch-email.txt` (i.e. patcher did not
return `PATCH_FAILED`). Use a **small/fast model** (e.g. Claude Haiku) —
see the model note in the agent file for when to reconsider this choice.

Launch with:
- The path to `patch-email.txt`
- The path to `report.md`
- The kernel source tree path (checked out to `PATCH_BASE`)

Wait for Steps 5 and 6 to complete, then regenerate `report.html` once:

```bash
pandoc report.md -o report.html --standalone
```

### ⚠️ Do NOT commit report output files

Never run `git add reports/` or `git add <report-dir>/`. The `reports/`
directory is listed in `.gitignore` and must stay out of the repository —
report files are local working artefacts, not part of the skill source.
If you need to record analysis progress, update the todo list or write
a summary in the session notes; do not commit files under `reports/`.

## "Unable to handle paging request" flow

Additional information gathering steps for paging request crashes (Phase 1, step 4).
After these steps are complete, the Entry Point Phase 2 (Deep Analysis flow) produces
the full What-How-Where report.

1. Note CR2 (the faulting address) and classify it:
   - NULL or near-NULL (< 0x1000): likely a NULL pointer dereference.
   - Valid-looking kernel address that is not mapped: use-after-free or bad pointer.
   - User-space address accessed from kernel context: missing access_ok() check.
2. Note the page fault error code bits (read/write, user/kernel, not-present vs. protection).

## WARNING flow

Additional information gathering steps for WARNING crashes (Phase 1, step 4).
After these steps are complete, the Entry Point Phase 2 (Deep Analysis flow) produces
the full What-How-Where report.

1. Note the exact warning text and the source location encoded in the WARNING header line.
2. Determine whether the warning is a developer-inserted assertion (`WARN_ON`) or a
   runtime consistency check.

## BUG / BUG_ON flow

Additional information gathering steps for BUG crashes (Phase 1, step 4).
After these steps are complete, the Entry Point Phase 2 (Deep Analysis flow) produces
the full What-How-Where report.

1. Extract the BUG condition — what assertion failed and the exact source location.
2. Note the BUG variant: `BUG()`, `BUG_ON()`, `VM_BUG_ON()`, `VM_BUG_ON_FOLIO()`, etc.,
   as this hints at which kernel subsystem considers the state impossible.

## Panic flow

Additional information gathering steps for Panic crashes (Phase 1, step 4).
After these steps are complete, the Entry Point Phase 2 (Deep Analysis flow) produces
the full What-How-Where report.

1. Identify the panic reason string (e.g. `Fatal exception in interrupt`).
2. If the panic followed an OOPS, treat the OOPS as the primary crash to analyse.
3. If it is a "soft lockup" or "hard lockup", note the CPU state and backtraces
   of all CPUs reported in the log.
